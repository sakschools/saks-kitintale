      <description>HEAD PREFECT’S MESSAGE The core of the issues is academics where we liaise with our teachers to see to it that the academic routine is carried out appropriately. In academic we monitor morning work which keeps pupils who arrive early busy as they await the official time, lunch hour to remind us of the already learnt content , to mention a few.&#xA;We are all around in that we go ahead to look at the general welfare as another priory, in this we monitor the meals right from storage to servicing, quality and quantity is our main concern I this area.</description>
