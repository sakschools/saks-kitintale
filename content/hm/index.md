# Head Teacher
I am delighted to welcome you to our school. There is something very unique about Sir Apollo Kaggwa- Kitintale that we are incredibly proud of our children, supportive parents, inspirational staff where all are committed to excel in all spheres as the school motto outlines.

Our vision is to be the number one education service provider. This is achieved through our administrators and dedicated staff, education managers who work as a close team to produce excellent services. At Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School – Kitintale, we believe that children deserve the best chances in life and therefore we encourage strong links with parents. Children at heart in whatever we do, we strive to foster their morals through a program called; “Building good Behavior and Character” among children “BBC”. To attach value to this program, children’s behavior is assessed at the end of term practically and theoretically through written exams
